      "BLUECODE is a Denim & Casualwear fabric collection launched in 2018 by Santista/Tavex in Argentina. We designed 12 products with different constructions, weights, indigo dying, fibres and compositions for menswear and womenswear collections, where I participated as Assistant Denim Manager. We worked on fabric development for several months, and I supported the manager (in collaboration with the I+D team) in the research for the fabric collection. I was in charge of the garments collection that we created to show the fabric potential and the trend direction of the season to our clients. I also participated in trend reporting, creating a report of more than 60 pages with plenty of information to send to our clients (B2B). I introduced the report and the new fabrics in the launch event. Pictures are from the campaign, the collection of fabrics and garments, and the launch event and client presentation.",

We were trying to show the denim market how important it is to experience things and explore life through all our senses. The slogan was: “You have to be here to see, touch, feel, smell and hear”. We collaborated with artists and brands to develop every sense, the scent, the sound, the colour, the hand, and the entire experience of denim. For this collection I was in charge of developing the fabrics, the concept, the communication, the garments, the washing, the labels, the launch event, the trend report, the conference and the clients’ experience. We worked several months to investigate trends, working with the I+D team and developed a collection of fabrics to offer to all the Argentinian Brands.",

      "FIBRA was a textile project in collaboration with Santista, EnRedando, Josefina Luna and local artisans from Argentina. EnRedando is a collaborative network that develops textile projects with a social and environmental impact. Josefina Luna is a designer who works with local communities and artisans to improve the Argentinian design identity. We worked together trying to find our identity in Denim, looking at the handcrafted textile work from Argentinean artisans, and local communities. We worked on a small scale to create a collection of fabrics, handwoven with ancient techniques by the artisans. We also explored the connection between the industry and local producers, and we found out that in Argentina we are still working in a local way, with natural fibres that grow on our land, even on a large scale. We developed three fabrics: TINKU, OHUANTA and RANDA, each of them made in a different region from our country, and handwoven with a different technique specific from each community.
