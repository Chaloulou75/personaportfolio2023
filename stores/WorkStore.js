      "BLUECODE is a Denim & Casualwear fabric collection launched in 2018 by Santista/Tavex in Argentina. We designed 12 products with different constructions, weights, indigo dying, fibres and compositions for menswear and womenswear collections, where I participated as Assistant Denim Manager. We worked on fabric development for several months, and I supported the manager (in collaboration with the I+D team) in the research for the fabric collection. I was in charge of the garments collection that we created to show the fabric potential and the trend direction of the season to our clients. I also participated in trend reporting, creating a report of more than 60 pages with plenty of information to send to our clients (B2B). I introduced the report and the new fabrics in the launch event. Pictures are from the campaign, the collection of fabrics and garments, and the launch event and client presentation.",
