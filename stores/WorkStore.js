We designed 12 products with different constructions, weights, indigo dying, fibres and compositions for menswear and womenswear collections, where I participated as Assistant Denim Manager. We worked on fabric development for several months, and I supported the manager (in collaboration with the I+D team) in the research for the fabric collection. I was in charge of the garments collection that we created to show the fabric potential and the trend direction of the season to our clients. I also participated in trend reporting, creating a report of more than 60 pages with plenty of information to send to our clients (B2B). I introduced the report and the new fabrics in the launch event. Pictures are from the campaign, the collection of fabrics and garments, and the launch event and client presentation.",

      "FIBRA was a textile project in collaboration with Santista, EnRedando, Josefina Luna and local artisans from Argentina. EnRedando is a collaborative network that develops textile projects with a social and environmental impact. Josefina Luna is a designer who works with local communities and artisans to improve the Argentinian design identity. We worked together trying to find our identity in Denim, looking at the handcrafted textile work from Argentinean artisans, and local communities. We worked on a small scale to create a collection of fabrics, handwoven with ancient techniques by the artisans. We also explored the connection between the industry and local producers, and we found out that in Argentina we are still working in a local way, with natural fibres that grow on our land, even on a large scale. We developed three fabrics: TINKU, OHUANTA and RANDA, each of them made in a different region from our country, and handwoven with a different technique specific from each community.

      "In the context of Buenos Aires Fashion Week, I won a space as a speaker for the introduction programme. With Ana Paula Alves, we developed a special presentation to talk about the history of the Denim Industry and some important facts to know about this amazing product that we both love. The name of the talk refers to the DEMOCRATIC aspect of this product, and how jeans are an essential part of every wardrobe. It also mentions the fact that jeans had a place in many historical moments and revolutions, for example when it became the hero material in rock band attire all over the world, when people searched for peace at Woodstock, and when it walked towards equality with the English feminist.",
